# D3-challenge

Data Journalism:

For this data visualization project I was tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping peoples, lives, as well as creating charts, graphs and interactive elements to help readers understand their findings for a major metro paper. 

The information is from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

The following was created:


-  A scatter plot between two of the data variables, Healthcare vs. Poverty.

-  Using D3 a scatter plot was created that represents each state with circle elements and abbreviations in the circles.

-  Additional labels, click events and animations were given to the graphs created so that the user could interact with them and pick and choose what they wanted to see with the data.
